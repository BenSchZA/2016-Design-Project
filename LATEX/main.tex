\section{TASK CLARIFICATION}
\subsection{Background}
UCT Upper campus has a number of parking areas for staff, students and visitors using cars to travel to campus. There are red, yellow, blue and unmarked bays on campus. In addition there are disabled and 
visitor parking bays on campus. These categories are assigned the highest priority. 

For every user, a parking category is assigned, and an associated annual fee is charged.  The purchase of a parking disk allows the staff member/student/visitor to search for a parking spot in the designated category on campus, but it is not guaranteed that one will be available, since parking bays are oversold. When arriving on campus, a driver of a car may spend some time searching for an available spot in the required category. Parking disks are generally linked to a person and only valid for the specific vehicle for which the disk has been purchased, except for student lift clubs.

The Traffic  Department  on  Upper  Campus  administrates  and  manages  all  aspects  related  to  parking  of vehicles.\cite{assignment}
 
\subsection{Problem Statement}
For  a  driver  entering  Upper  Campus  in  a  car,  it  is  not immediately  apparent  where  there  are  parking bays available.  This is a particular problem during peak times when a large number of cars arrive on campus, looking for parking at the same time. The design assignment is to solve this problem using the electrical engineering skills of each of the team members in your group.\cite{assignment}

The design assignment is:

\begin{itemize}
\item To provide information in an easily accessible format, to each driver of a car immediately on arrival on campus, on where all the vacant parking bays on campus are. This must be for the specific category of parking for this user.

\item To determine whether a vehicle is parked on a bay not designated for this user, for example a yellow disk holder parks on a red bay, or a visitor parks on a disabled parking bay, and make this available to the traffic department in real time.

\item To  allow electronic reconfiguration  of  traffic  bay allocations  on  special  occasions, for example during the summer school period, when there are many visitors requiring parking on campus.

\item To monitor and log the use of parking bays and the percentage of occupation of each parking area and make this available to the traffic department, for the purpose of planning.\cite{assignment}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Economic Factors}
\lsec{Market Analysis}
UCT allocates about 2.8 users per parking bay, with about 5000 parking bays available on campus. This means UCT has approximately 14000 parking disk holders who pay R500 each to park on campus for the year. This means the cash flow coming into the traffic department, assuming no external funding is received, is approximately R13.4 million per year.

\section{CONCEPTUAL DESIGN}
\subsection{Design One}
Design One (D1) uses a triangulation system to locate the registered vehicle within the parking area. Each registered vehicle has a tag with a unique ID - this ID has the user data linked to it in a database on the server back-end. The location of each parking space is known, and with the knowledge of where the vehicle is located it can be determined whether the vehicle is legally parked or not. 
  
\subsubsection{System Diagram}
\subsubsection{System Components}
\lsec{Tags and Beacons}
Due to a triangulation system being used, in every parking area there are at least three beacons - with four being used to try to eliminate signal propagation issues. The tags and beacons make use of a Decawave DW1000 ultra-wideband transceiver chip that is controlled via SPI from a Atmel micro-controller. 

The master beacon sends a signal out to synchronise all the beacons to the same time reference. Each tag sends a signal periodically with the unique user ID, transmit time and battery level which is received by each of the beacons. The beacons all relay time of flight data back to the master beacon which performs a time difference of arrival (TDOA) calculation to determine where the tag is located.\cite{decawave-presentation}

The tags transmit with a period of 5-10 minutes. This reduces power consumption and signal noise level interference with other tags. The tags do not receive data. The tags will be accurate to within 10cm giving more than enough accuracy for the application. The initial conservative battery life estimate is 5 years with proper power management in software. They will be powered with a LiPo battery that will need to be replaced or charged when discharged.

The beacons will use the same circuitry, but with different software running on the Atmel micro-controller. They will be required to both transmit and receive. The beacons will be mounted on poles (both light and installed) distributed across the UCT campus - this will allow the location of vehicles in any area. They will be powered with LiPo batteries which will be charged with solar panels - or wired in cases where this is not practical.

\lsec{Server Back-end}
The server back-end connects with the master beacon via WiFi and receives the tag location, unique ID and battery level for every new vehicle. This is updated on a database every 5-10 minutes. Further calculations and visualizations are performed and stored in the database to send to the end user. The following data will be available for each unique ID:

\begin{itemize}
\item User privileges.
\item Tag location (updated periodically).
\item Tag battery level (updated periodically).
\end{itemize}

\lsec{User Interface}
The user interface will connect with the server back-end to access the database and will relay the following data to the end user via a smart phone application or web application: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Indication of privilege level and violations.
\item Tag battery level.
\item Vehicle location.
\item Location of open parking bays.
\item Recommended parking area.
\item Number of free parking bays in parking area.
\item Traffic heat-map on campus.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendation}
Based on the weighted selection and evaluation above, Design One should be further developed as a viable parking system solution for UCT upper campus. The embodiment design should be completed along with the necessary analysis and system testing.

\subsubsection{RF Design}


\lsec{Antenna Specifciations:\cite{DW-antenna}}

Friss's Transmission Equation states the following:
$$P_{RX} = \frac{P_{TX}G_{TX}G_{RX} \lambda^2}{(4 \pi r)^2}$$
There is a quadratic relationship between the received power ($P_{RX}$) and the distance r from the tag to the beacon. This means we need to optimize the received power in another way, as the distance r can not be optimized except by having a dense beacon installation. The transmit power ($P_{TX}$) needs to be kept as low as possible, to optimize battery usage - this means the transmit and received antenna gain need to be made as high as is possible. The tag has a limited space profile, which means the beacon antenna needs to be as large as possible. Unfortunately the beacon antenna needs to be fairly omni-directional in order to pick up all the tags, as will be explained below, this further limits the possible receiver gain.

Because the antenna gains are measured using decibels which are on a logarithmic scale, the following changes in the equation need to be made:

$$P_{RX} = P_{TX} + G_{TX} + G_{R} + 20log_{10}(\frac{\lambda}{4 \pi R})$$

We would like to achieve at least a 60 percent transmission efficiency (this means 60 percent of the transmitted power is received) with a target of 90 percent efficiency. Designing for a 75 percent efficiency will help us achieve this target: 

$$\lambda = \frac{300e6}{f} = \frac{300e6}{3GHz} = 0.1m$$

$$EIRP(f) = P_{TX}G_{TX} = -41.3dBm/MHz$$
\begin{center}
value as mentioned below in regulations. This means the peak transmitter power and peak transmitter antenna gain must give a product within the regulations.
\end{center}

$$\frac{P_{RX}}{P_{TX}} = 0.75 = \frac{G_{TX}G_{RX} \times 0.1}{(4 \pi \times 200)^2} = $$

The tag antenna specifications are based on the calculations above and using the AH086M555003 PCB chip antenna from Mouser which has a wide operating range from 3100MHz to 8000MHz.

\newpage
\lsec{ICASA National Radio Frequency Plan:\cite{ICASA}\cite{UWB-Regs}}
The ICASA 2013 NRFP for ITU Region 1 allocates the frequency range from 3.3GHz to 3.4GHz to radio-location with a typical application of government services. In South Africa there are no specific regulations for UWB signals. The Decawave technology is ETSI compliant and will generally be accepted by ICASA so long as EMF and RF mitigation techniques are used. The regulations permit outdoor use on the frequency range 3.1-4.8GHz with an EIRP of -41.3dBm/MHz. The ETSI regulations permit the use of the Decawave chips in an indoor and outdoor environment.

\lsec{DW1000 Frequency Channels:\cite{DW-antenna}}
The DW1000 can be programmed to use specific frequency channels (defined by the IEEE 802.15.4a-2011 standard) with corresponding bandwidth. Based on the ICASA regulations above, Channel 1 would be used with a Centre Frequency of 3493.4MHz and an operational bandwidth of 500MHz. This falls within the informal regulations mentioned above.
